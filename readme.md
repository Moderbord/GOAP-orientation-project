# Introduction
This is part of an academic project meant to develop an area of interest in the field of computer game science. For this project, a GOAP implementation based on Jeff Orkins research papers were applied to an existing AI solution for a lightweight RTS game made in Pygame. The previous solution were based heavily on finite state machines, thus lacking in extensibility and ability for dynamic AI behavior.

## Requirements
The project was developed with python 3.8.2 and pygame 1.9.6.  
Pygame recommends using at least python 3.7.7

### Recomended
**Python 3.8.2**  
**Pygame 1.9.6**  

### Minimum
**Python 3.7.0**  
**Pygame 1.9.4**  

## How to run
Run main.py after installing package requirements.
